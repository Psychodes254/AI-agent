# Code Review Rules

These are the high-level rules and patterns that I will follow when reviewing code.

1. **Clarity and Simplicity**: Code should be easy to read, understand, and maintain. Avoid unnecessary complexity, and prefer clear and descriptive naming.

2. **Consistency**: Code should adhere to the existing conventions, patterns, and formatting of the codebase. This ensures that the codebase is easy to navigate and understand for all contributors.

3. **Correctness and Robustness**: Code should be functionally correct and handle errors gracefully. It should be tested for edge cases and potential failures.

4. **Security**: Code should be free of common security vulnerabilities. This includes, but is not limited to, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure direct object references.

5. **Test Coverage**: All new code should have adequate test coverage. Tests should be meaningful and reliable, and they should cover both the happy path and edge cases.
